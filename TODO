High Level:
- quantifier for modes
- commands with motions embedded :(
- display line numbers on the left margin
    - and ~ if no line exists
- display information on right status bar

Keys needed to do:
- Macros
- a 
    - b (done)
- cc 
- c[motion] (what's difference between c and d?)
- dd
    - d[anymotion] (done)
    - f (done)
    - h j k l (done)
    - i (mostly done)
    - n (done)
- o (append new line after current one, basically insert mode but move down first) - hard
- p (paste after cursor)
- q (record macro)
    - r (replace a single character) done
- s (remove character and go to insert mode/ it is very tricky with quantifier) 
- u (undo) (mostly done)
- w (motion) to some definition of word (can be multiline) (done)
    - x (done)
- yy 
- y (copy/yank)

- A (go to end of line and insert mode)
    - F (find back) (done)
- I (insert mode at the beggining of the line)
- J (go to end of line and delete new line character)
    - N (mostly done find backwards) (done)
- O (like o but opens line up)
- P (paste before cursor)
- R (replace mode)
- S (delete line and go to insert mode)
    - X (done)
    - ^ (motion beggining of line first nonempty character) (done)
    - $ (done)
    - 0 (first character) (done)
    - . (done)
    - ; (repeats last f some number of times / this is bad) (done) lambda is awesome <3
    - / (mostly done)
    - ? (like /)
- % (move to matching parantheses)

- ^b ^d ^f  ^u -scrolling
- ^g some information

    - : line number (done)

- @ (run macro)
